# Q & A
Q: How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?

A: At the end of the session, jammers are given a chance to fully customize their game by changing up the assets, adding custom stuff etc...

Q: Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?

A: For people who don't know how to code, this is a godsend, for reference, I made a decently fun turret shooter game when I was what, 12? Even for people that know how to code, this is quite fun. Speaking from my personal experience in the past, even after having coded some bots and websites at that time, I still had a blast making a game using GDevelop because using it really lets you focus more on the game making aspect, instead of the coding & debugging...

Q: What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)

A: A cool game that they can customize easily and a basic understanding on the high level logic behind game development.

---

Q: What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?

A: Letting people make their own cool game regardless of skill level, therefore making this workshop interesting even for people with zero coding skills. Also the sense of accomplishment in exporting your own game in the end after customizing it.

Q: What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?

A: Everything except mobile would probably work fine with GDevelop's web editor.

Q: How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?

A: A showcase session at the end, letting people demo their own versions of the game.
