# Q & A
Q: How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?

A: At the end of the session, jammers are given a chance to fully customize their game by changing up the assets, adding custom stuff etc...

Q: Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?

A: For people who don't know how to code, this is a godsend, for reference, I made a decently fun turret shooter game when I was what, 12? Even for people that know how to code, this is quite fun. Speaking from my personal experience in the past, even after having coded some bots and websites at that time, I still had a blast making a game using GDevelop because using it really lets you focus more on the game making aspect, instead of the coding & debugging...
